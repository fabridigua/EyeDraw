## Basic Overview
This project aims to investigate the potential of computer vision in eyes detection for the development of a real-time application with the use of a simple webcam. **OpenCV** is used for both the GUI and the algorithmic part. 

The execution consists of 3 phases:

| 1. Threshold Settings                                        | 2. Calibration                                               | 3. Draw                                                      |

| <img src="1.threshold.png" style="zoom:33%;" />              | <img src="2.calibration.png" style="zoom:33%;" />            | <img src="3.paint.png" style="zoom:33%;" />                  |
| Your face and eyes are detected in real-time. You must set two important threshold to improve and stabilize the detection. | The calibration is performed making you follow the circle with your eyes for about 30 seconds. | You can draw! Move the cursor on the canvas and draw what you want. Custom options and colors are available. |
